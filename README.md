# Intelligent greenhouse


## Description
This greenhouse was created as a college assignment,it solves three big problems:temperature problem, light problem and moisture problem. It receives dates from 3 analog sensors and it controls 3 servo-motors.

## Visuals 
Screenshots and photos with the project can be found in the documentatie.docx 

## Instalation
At first, you must connect the sensors to the Arduino Uno analogic pins (A0,A1,A2); then connect the servo-motors to the digital pins (9,10,11) and connect the plate to a computer. Upload the code on the plate and your mini greenhouse is ready.

## Roadmap
I will improve the project in near future by adding more sensors, and implementing this project for my own greenhouse.
